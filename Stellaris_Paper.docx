Abstract: We report first experimental evidence of dark photon to standard model photon conversion in electromagnetic fields approaching the Schwinger limit. Using a purpose-built quantum vacuum engineering apparatus, we observed anomalous photon emission consistent with dark photon conversion at 5.2σ significance...
